Forsch Cording is a tall, gaunt man with apparent clairvoyant ability. He appears no older than 35, but evokes the aura
of someone much older. Internet search of the man yields that he recently held post as a professor of ancient studies at
the University of Toronto and is vaguely associated with the Projet du Méridional, which translates from French to
English as the 'Southern Project'. An urban legend among fringe academics, Projet du Méridional is associated with both
the study of anthropology and the paranormal. It is supposedly funded privately by a group of five men, one of whom
being Cording. A dubious-looking site reports that Cording has been traveling the world for the past two years
researching a supposed curse that had stricken an Irish family. On October 9th, 2005, Cording recruits a videographer
named William Roydon to travel with him to the town of Robin Song, VA. His goal is to find, and put a stop to, the
malevolent spirit of Gretchen Plowzer. Cording believes Plowzer's ghost is responsible for the dark and reprehensible
events plaguing the town's history. A serious man, Cording speaks to Roydon in a calm, flat monotone. While in Robin
Song he behaves very strangely; walking around, often aimlessly, while listening to something Roydon cannot hear.
Cording eventually lets on that he is aware of numerous places like Robin Song and that his purpose is to help remedy
such hauntings, thus insinuating his involvement with Projet du Méridional. A missing persons poster portraying
Cording's image is seen by Roydon taped to the crumbling bedroom wall of Irwin Settle, a deranged man who was put to
death in 1997 after the abduction and brutal murder of his psychiatrist, Dr. Steen. The 'last seen' date on the poster
is the current date, October 9th, 2005. A few hours later, Cording is attacked by, who we assume to be, the spirit of
Gretchen Plowzer. His fate is unknown.
