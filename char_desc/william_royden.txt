William Royden is a videographer who has lived in Annapolis, MD since he was 13-years old.
From ages 5-12 he lived with his family in the small town of Robinsong, VA where he attended
Cotton Elementary for grades 1 through 6. Royden has a grandfather who still lives in Robinsond that
he visits on occasion. On October 9th, 2005, Royden is paid $500 by a mysterious man named Forsh Cording
to accompany his to Robinsong and assist in confronting the malevolent spirit of Gretchen Plowzer, who
Cording believes is responsible for the strange and terrifying events experienced by the town's citizens.
This task causes Royden severe physical and psychological torment. He abandons his post and flees his
hometown of Robinsong by train. He does not return, even to visit his grandfather.
