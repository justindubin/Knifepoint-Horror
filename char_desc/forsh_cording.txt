Forsh Cording is a mysterious man with supposed clairvoyant abilities. He appears no older than 35,
but evokes the aura of someone much older. Internet search of the man only yields the fact that he
recently held post as a professor of ancient studies at the University of Toronto. On October 9th, 2005,
Cording recruits a videographer named William Royden to travel with him to the town of Robinsong, VA. His
goal is to find, and put a stop to, the malevolent spirit of Gretchen Plowzer. Cording believes Plowzer's
ghost is responsible for the dark and reprehensible events plaguing the town's history. A serious man,
Cording speaks to Royden in a calm, flat monotone. While in Robinsong he behaves very strangely; walking
around, often aimlessly, while listening to something Royden cannot hear. Cording eventually lets on that
he is aware of numerous places like Robinsong and that his purpose is to help remedy such hauntings. A
missing persons poster portraying Cording's image is seen by Royden taped to the crumbling bedroom wall of
Irwin Settle, a deranged man who was put to death in 1997 after the abduction and brutal murder of his
psychiatrist, Dr. Steen. The 'last seen' date on the poster is the current date, October 9th, 2005. A few
hours later, Cording is attacked by, who we assume to be, the spirit of Gretchen Plowzer. His fate is unknown.
